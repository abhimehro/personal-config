# ELIR Handoff: `fix-allowlist-format.py` Testing Improvement

📋 **Purpose:**
Added comprehensive unit test coverage for the `extract_allowlist_domains_from_file` function in `adguard/scripts/fix-allowlist-format.py`. The tests document the function's existing behavior across 10+ edge cases including missing files, invalid JSON, and missing keys.

🛡️ **Security:**
The script currently parses files securely, though error swallowing could obscure failures. The tests mock the file system with `unittest.mock.mock_open` ensuring isolated test execution without actual side effects.

⚠️ **Failure Modes:**

- The function currently uses a generic `except Exception as e` to catch errors and returns an empty list. The test verifies this behavior explicitly. If we decide to tighten error propagation in the future (e.g. letting `json.JSONDecodeError` surface), these tests will intentionally fail to guide the refactoring.

✅ **Review Checklist:**

- [ ] Review `tests/test_fix_allowlist_format.py` to confirm the test matrix matches expectations.
- [ ] Verify `adguard/scripts/import_fix_allowlist_format.py` acts as a safe dynamic import wrapper.
- [ ] Ensure all 11 tests pass successfully locally (`python3 -m unittest tests/test_fix_allowlist_format.py`).

🔧 **Maintenance:**
The tests run efficiently and purely in memory without affecting the host filesystem, aligning with the project's testing practices. The integration test safely creates and deletes its temporary file.

# 🧪 Testing Improvement: test_infuse_media_server.py

## 🎯 What

Addressed a testing gap in `media-streaming/archive/scripts/infuse-media-server.py` by adding a dedicated unit test for the `send_auth_request` method on the `MediaServerHandler` class.

## 📊 Coverage

The new test covers the following scenarios:

- Verifies that `send_response(401)` is sent.
- Validates that the HTTP header `WWW-Authenticate` is set with the correct `Basic realm="Infuse Media Server"`.
- Checks that `end_headers` is invoked.
- Asserts the response body payload is written as `b'Authentication required'`.

## ✨ Result

Increased test coverage for the media streaming logic in isolation. The testing module leverages `unittest.mock.MagicMock` to stub out socket interactions by instantiating the HTTP handler using `__new__` to bypass initialization. This prevents tests from being flaky or relying on external networking configurations.

═════ ELIR ═════
PURPOSE: Provide a robust, isolated unit test to ensure HTTP headers and 401 response statuses are appropriately managed during unauthorized media server queries.
SECURITY: Validates expected HTTP authentication challenge formats are adhered to strictly.
FAILS IF: The implementation of `send_auth_request` modifies its response status code or removes the Basic realm header.
VERIFY: Run `python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -p 'test_*.py'` to ensure isolation and zero socket interaction.
MAINTAIN: Avoid modifying `__init__` in a way that breaks instantiation via `__new__` in the testing suite without adjusting the mock objects respectively.
