## 2025-10-21 - Command Injection in Notification System
**Vulnerability:** Found unsanitized input being passed to `eval` in `smart_notify` function.
**Learning:** Even internal helper scripts can be vulnerable if they construct commands via string concatenation and use `eval`. Inputs like notification titles might come from external sources (logs, filenames) and trigger execution.
**Prevention:** Avoid `eval`. Use direct command execution. If constructing complex arguments, verify quoting or use arrays. For AppleScript, escape quotes and backslashes.
## 2025-10-18 - [Insecure Local Media Sharing]
**Vulnerability:** The `media-streaming/scripts/alldebrid-server.py` and `infuse-media-server.py` scripts expose the file system via HTTP on `0.0.0.0` without authentication.
**Learning:** These scripts are designed for local network sharing (Infuse integration) but lack basic security controls, relying solely on network trust. This is a significant gap if the device connects to untrusted networks.
**Prevention:** Always bind to `127.0.0.1` by default for development/local tools. If public/LAN access is needed, enforce authentication (Basic Auth or similar) or use secure tunneling.
