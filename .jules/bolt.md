## 2025-12-28 - Shell Script Performance Optimization
**Learning:** In Bash scripts, spawning subshells (e.g., `$(date)`) and pipelines (e.g., `| tr`) inside frequently called functions (like logging) creates significant overhead. Using Bash built-ins like `printf %(...)T` and parameter expansion `${var##*/}` is much faster. Also, be careful with `set -e` and functions that return false (like conditional checks returning non-zero) - always ensure they return true or handle the exit code.
**Action:** When optimizing shell scripts, prioritize replacing external command calls with built-ins inside loops or hot paths.
