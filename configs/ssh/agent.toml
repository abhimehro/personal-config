# This is the 1Password SSH agent config file, which allows you to customize the
# behavior of the SSH agent running on this machine.
#
# You can use it to:
# * Enable keys from other vaults than the Private vault
# * Control the order in which keys are offered to SSH servers
#
# More examples can be found here:
#  https://developer.1password.com/docs/ssh/agent/config

# Enable SSH keys from your Personal vault first (for cursor-local)
[[ssh-keys]]
item = "Abhi Mehrotra's MacBook Pro - SSH Key"
vault = "Personal"

# Enable all SSH keys from Private vault as fallback
[[ssh-keys]]
vault = "Private"
