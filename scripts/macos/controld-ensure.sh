# Control D DNS Configuration Enforcement Script (Separation Strategy aware)
# Ensures that when Control D mode is active, the network state remains
# consistent. This script now delegates to the unified network-mode-manager
# rather than directly forcing DNS/IPv4/IPv6, to avoid fighting Windscribe.
#
# Usage: bash controld-ensure.sh
# Auto-runs via LaunchAgent at login
#
# Last Updated: Phase 1 Separation Strategy
