  "description": "Prisma Migrate Dev is used to update Prisma whenever the schema.prisma file has been modified. Always provide a descriptive name argument describing the change that was made to the Prisma Schema.\n\n            The migrate dev command performs these steps:\n\n            1. Reruns the existing migration history in the shadow database in order to detect schema drift (edited or deleted migration file, or a manual changes to the database schema)\n            2. Applies pending migrations to the shadow database (for example, new migrations created by colleagues)\n            3. Generates a new migration from any changes you made to the Prisma schema before running migrate dev\n            4. Applies all unapplied migrations to the development database and updates the _prisma_migrations table\n            5. Triggers the generation of artifacts (for example, Prisma Client)",
