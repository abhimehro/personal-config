# Security-First PR Review (Jules-Aware)

## Purpose

Standardize PR reviews across:

- `personal-config`
- `email-security-pipeline`
- `ctrld-sync`

All reviews must be:

- Security-first
- Checklist-driven
- Auditable (ELIR-aligned)
- Explicit about uncertainty

## When to use

Use this skill when:

- The user asks to review a PR or a diff
- The PR is labeled/prefixed **Sentinel** (security), **Bolt** (performance), or **Palette** (aesthetics/UX)
- The PR is AI-assisted or agent-generated (Jules/Copilot/Gemini present)
- The user asks, “Is this safe?”

## Operating rules

- Always include: `Route: T2+S+H`
- Choose **exactly one** Primary mode:
  - Security
  - Performance
  - Aesthetics
- If multiple apply:
  - still choose one primary mode
  - but review in this order: **Security → Performance → Aesthetics**
- Always list security concerns first, even when primary mode ≠ Security
- For agent-assisted PRs:
  - Never claim “safe”
  - Only claim “no obvious issues found” and require human verification

## Output template (always use)

```markdown
Route: T2+S+H

## Summary

- **Repo**: [personal-config | email-security-pipeline | ctrld-sync]
- **PR type**: [Agent-assisted | Human-authored | Mixed]
- **Primary mode**: [Security | Performance | Aesthetics]
- **Scope**: [1–2 sentences: what changed]
- **Risk surface**: [low | medium | high] (based on touched files + trust boundaries)

## Checklist

- [ ] **Correctness**: [Pass/Concern + 1-line why]
- [ ] **Security**: [Pass/Concern + 1-line why]
- [ ] **Performance**: [Pass/Concern or N/A + 1-line why]
- [ ] **Maintainability**: [Pass/Concern + 1-line why]
- [ ] **Testing**: [Pass/Concern + what’s missing]

## Categorized Findings

### Security

- **Critical (must fix before merge)**
  - [Issue + file:line + fix recommendation]
- **Suggestions**
  - [Suggestion + file:line]

### Performance

- **Critical (must fix before merge)**

### Aesthetics / Clarity

- **Critical (must fix before merge)**
  - [Issue + file:line + fix recommendation]
- **Suggestions**
  - [Suggestion + file:line]

## Verification (safe, non-destructive)

- [ ] Suggested checks to run (only if they exist in this repo): [...]
- [ ] What output increases confidence: [...]

## Mapping: Review Comment → Fix (if autofixing)

- Comment source: [Copilot | Gemini | Human]
  - Comment: [...]
  - Proposed fix: [...]
  - Files: [...]

## ELIR

- **PURPOSE**: [What this PR accomplishes and why]
- **SECURITY**: [Threats touched, protections, assumptions, trust boundaries]
- **FAILURE MODES**: [What could break → consequence → mitigation]
- **VERIFY**: [What the human should double-check]
- **MAINTAIN**: [Future dev notes + pitfalls]
```

## Mode selection guidance

Pick the primary mode using:

- **Title prefix**
  - Sentinel → Security
  - Bolt → Performance
  - Palette → Aesthetics

- **If unclear, choose based on the most sensitive surface touched**
  - Shell execution, secrets/env handling, network/DNS, launchd/services → Security
  - Hot paths, loops, regex work, I/O, concurrency → Performance
  - Naming, docs, output formatting, UI/UX → Aesthetics

## Repo-specific trust boundary reminders (review focus)

- **personal-config**
  - Shell scripts, launchd plists, DNS/VPN behavior, filesystem operations, privilege boundaries
- **email-security-pipeline**
  - Parsing untrusted email content, attachment handling, file type validation, logging of sensitive fields
- **ctrld-sync**
  - External JSON inputs, API requests/retry logic, output/log sanitization, config/.env handling

## Jules/Copilot/Gemini handling

When review input is generated by bots:

- Treat it as signal, not truth
- If a suggested change alters behavior or security posture, flag it as **Needs human decision**
- Never rubber-stamp; always require verification steps

[Thinking] **Reviewing PR changes**

The user invoked the code-review-security-first skill and provided a diff for review. I don't need to use any tools since the diff is small. The repository is personal-config, and it seems the PR type is likely Human-authored, but it's unspecified. 

Now, regarding the changes: There's a new entry in configs/.gitconfig that uses an absolute path for a commit template. This could affect portability across different machines due to the hardcoded path, but it seems acceptable from a security standpoint. However, it might lead to issues if the template contains sensitive information.
**Analyzing PR security changes**

The changes might be acceptable, but the user could consider using `/.config/git/...` or includeIf directives for per-repo templates instead of a global setup. They've also added a tracked `.gitmessage` file while showing another untracked `.gitmessage link`, suggesting they might want the commit template at the repo level.

Regarding the changes: The deletion of the `cursor` git submodule doesn't introduce further security issues. However, in `scripts/sync_all_configs.sh`, they removed quotes from variables, which could lead to potential problems. It's really crucial to keep quotes to avoid any word splitting or globbing issues; that's definitely a regression in safety.
**Reviewing script changes**

I'm finding a few concerning changes. They switched `[[ -n "$perms" ]]` to `[[ -n $perms ]]`, which again removes quotes. There's a significant bug where `mkdir -p "${HOME/.config/git"` is syntactically invalid due to misplaced braces; it should be `mkdir -p "${HOME}/.config/git"` or better, `mkdir -p "$HOME/.config/git"`.

Since the script operates on `$HOME` and `$REPO_ROOT`, unquoted variables raise concerns for path injection vulnerabilities, especially if these contain spaces or globs. While these environment variables are set earlier in the script, the consistent policy is to quote variables for safety. I’d assess the risk surface as medium, given its impact on dotfiles and symlink management. 

I need to follow a structured template with sections like Summary and Checklist. While we don’t have exact line numbers, I can approximate where these changes happen, such as `scripts/sync_all_configs.sh:25`.
**Clarifying commit template paths**

From the context, I can make some approximations about the lines—the first `if` is likely around line 25. I also need to highlight that the commit template path in the documentation mentions `/.config/git/commit-template.personal-config.txt`, but the actual `.gitconfig` uses an absolute path like `/Users/...`. 

Inside the synchronization script, there's a comment suggesting it assumes the use of `/.config/git/...`, which doesn't match the absolute path. While the path expansion works, it might create issues on other machines with different usernames. A more portable suggestion would be to use `template = /.config/git/...` in the global config, as it should expand correctly.
**Identifying critical issues in the script**

I need to emphasize the invalid `mkdir` command and the quoting regressions, classifying these as critical security issues since they could break the script and violate shell safety. I suggest testing the script by running `bash -n scripts/sync_all_configs.sh` to check for syntax errors and possibly using `./scripts/sync_all_configs.sh --dry-run`, if that's an option. I'll definitely mention the `bash -n` command and briefly explain what it does. I want to maintain a moderate level of detail while following the user's request for a review rather than an autofix.
Route: T2+S+H  

## Summary

- **Repo**: personal-config  
- **PR type**: Human-authored (assumed)  
- **Primary mode**: Security  
- **Scope**: Adds a Git commit template configuration and wires it into `sync_all_configs.sh`; removes the `cursor` submodule; refactors several shell conditionals/variable usages.  
- **Risk surface**: **Medium** — shell script that mutates files/symlinks in `$HOME` plus global Git config behavior.  

## Checklist

- [ ] **Correctness**: **Concern** — `mkdir -p` command is syntactically invalid and will cause the script to fail.  
- [ ] **Security**: **Concern** — multiple regressions in shell quoting around path variables increase risk of bugs and go against your own safety rules.  
- [ ] **Performance**: **N/A** — no meaningful perf-sensitive paths touched.  
- [ ] **Maintainability**: **Concern** — mixing of quoting styles and a hardcoded absolute path in `.gitconfig` reduce portability and clarity.  
- [ ] **Testing**: **Concern** — changes touch install/bootstrap logic and should be validated at least with `bash -n` and a safe local run.  

## Categorized Findings

### Security

- **Critical (must fix before merge)**  
  - **Unquoted path checks in shell script**  
    - `scripts/sync_all_configs.sh`: `if [[ ! -d $REPO_ROOT ]]; then` (and similar `[[ ! -e $target ]]`, `[[ -L $link ]]`, `[[ -n $perms ]]`) remove quotes around variables that represent filesystem paths.  
    - **Why it matters**: Violates your own policy (“quote all variables”), can misbehave if `$REPO_ROOT`, `$target`, or others ever contain spaces or glob characters, and is a general shell-safety regression in a script that mutates `$HOME`.  
    - **Fix recommendation**: Revert to the safe, quoted forms everywhere:  
      - `[[ ! -d "$REPO_ROOT" ]]`, `[[ ! -e "$target" ]]`, `[[ -L "$link" ]]`, `[[ -n "$perms" ]]`, etc.  

  - **Broken `mkdir` command for Git template directory**  
    - `scripts/sync_all_configs.sh` (Git commit template setup block): `mkdir -p "${HOME/.config/git"` — missing closing brace and slash.  
    - **Why it matters**: Script will fail at runtime when this line executes, preventing configs from being synced and potentially leaving the system in a half-configured state.  
    - **Fix recommendation**: Correct to a standard, quoted path expression, e.g.:  
      - `mkdir -p "$HOME/.config/git"`  

- **Suggestions**  
  - **Hardcoded absolute path for Git commit template**  
    - `configs/.gitconfig`: `template = /Users/speedybee/.config/git/commit-template.personal-config.txt`  
    - **Why it matters**: Works on your current machine but bakes your macOS username and `/Users/...` layout into a repo-managed config. This is more of a portability/maintainability concern than a direct security issue, but it does couple the config tightly to one environment.  
    - **Fix recommendation**: Prefer a home-relative path Git will expand, e.g. `template = ~/.config/git/commit-template.personal-config.txt`, and consider documenting in `docs/` that `sync_all_configs.sh` ensures the symlink backing this path.  

### Performance

- **Critical (must fix before merge)**  
  - None.  

- **Suggestions**  
  - None; perf impact is negligible here.  

### Aesthetics / Clarity

- **Critical (must fix before merge)**  
  - **Inconsistent quoting and style drift**  
    - `scripts/sync_all_configs.sh`: the mix of quoted and unquoted variables in conditionals (e.g., `[[ -L $link ]]` vs previous `[[ -L "$link" ]]`) makes the script harder to audit and maintain and contradicts `AGENTS.md` shell guidelines.  
    - **Fix recommendation**: Normalize the script to consistently quote all variable expansions, especially in tests and filesystem operations.  

- **Suggestions**  
  - **Comment vs reality alignment for commit template assumption**  
    - `scripts/sync_all_configs.sh`: comment says `.gitconfig uses ~/.config/git/commit-template.personal-config.txt`, while the actual config uses an absolute `/Users/...` path. They resolve to the same location today, but the mismatch is slightly confusing to future you.  
    - **Fix recommendation**: Align the comment and config — either change the comment to mention the absolute path, or adjust `.gitconfig` to the `~/.config/...` form.  

## Verification (safe, non-destructive)

- [ ] Run `bash -n scripts/sync_all_configs.sh` to catch syntax issues (this should immediately surface the `mkdir -p` bug).  
- [ ] On a test machine or with a backup of your home config, run `./scripts/sync_all_configs.sh` and confirm:  
  - It completes without errors.  
  - `~/.gitconfig` is correctly symlinked to `configs/.gitconfig`.  
  - `$HOME/.config/git/commit-template.personal-config.txt` exists and is a symlink to `.gitmessage`.  
  - Running `git commit` in an arbitrary repo does not produce “could not read template” warnings.  

- [ ] Optionally test on a second macOS account (or another host) to confirm the absolute template path in `.gitconfig` behaves as expected and doesn’t assume the same username.  

- [ ] What output increases confidence:  
  - No errors from `bash -n`.  
  - Idempotent behavior from `sync_all_configs.sh` (re-running prints “symlink is intact” messages and does not create extra backups).  
  - `git config --get commit.template` matches the path that `sync_all_configs.sh` ensures, and `ls -l` shows the symlink chain is correct.  

## Mapping: Review Comment → Fix (if autofixing)

- Comment source: Human (this review)  
  - Comment: “Unquoted variables in shell conditions and broken mkdir path.”  
  - Proposed fix: Restore and enforce quoted variables and correct the `mkdir -p` path as described above.  
  - Files: `scripts/sync_all_configs.sh`, `configs/.gitconfig` (for optional portability improvement).  

## ELIR

- **PURPOSE**: This change aims to wire a repo-managed Git commit message template into your global Git config and ensure `sync_all_configs.sh` installs it safely alongside other dotfiles, while removing an unused `cursor` submodule.  
- **SECURITY**: The main trust boundary is the shell script’s control over files and symlinks in `$HOME`; safe quoting and correct path handling are required to avoid misdirected writes or surprising behavior. The current diff weakens your shell-safety posture by unquoting path variables and introduces a syntax error that can break the bootstrap process.  
- **FAILURE MODES**:  
  - If `mkdir -p` remains broken, the script will fail when setting up the commit template, leaving configs partially applied.  
  - If unquoted variables remain, future changes that alter `$REPO_ROOT`/targets (or edge cases like spaces) could cause incorrect backups/symlinks or hard-to-debug behavior.  
  - The absolute path in `.gitconfig` may fail on hosts where `$HOME` is not `/Users/speedybee`, causing `git commit` to error on template loading.  
- **VERIFY**: After applying the fixes, you should double-check that the script passes `bash -n`, runs cleanly end-to-end, and that `git commit` in multiple repos uses the desired template without warnings on at least one fresh environment.  
- **MAINTAIN**: Treat `scripts/sync_all_configs.sh` as security-sensitive bootstrap code: keep all variable expansions quoted, favor simple, readable path logic, and ensure any changes to commit-template paths are reflected consistently in both `.gitconfig` and the script (plus docs if present).
