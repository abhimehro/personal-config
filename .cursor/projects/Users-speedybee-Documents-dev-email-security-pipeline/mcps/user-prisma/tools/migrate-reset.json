Only run this command on a development database - never on production databases! If in doubt, ask the user to confirm.\n\n                The migrate reset command performs these steps:\n\n                1. Drops the database/schema if possible, or performs a soft reset if the environment does not allow deleting databases/schemas\n                2. Creates a new database/schema with the same name if the database/schema was dropped\n                3. Applies all migrations\n                4. Runs seed scripts",
