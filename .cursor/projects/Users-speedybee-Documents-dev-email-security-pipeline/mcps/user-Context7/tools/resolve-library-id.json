  "description": "Resolves a package/product name to a Context7-compatible library ID and returns matching libraries.\n\nYou MUST call this function before 'query-docs' to obtain a valid Context7-compatible library ID UNLESS the user explicitly provides a library ID in the format '/org/project' or '/org/project/version' in their query.\n\nSelection Process:\n1. Analyze the query to understand what library/package the user is looking for\n2. Return the most relevant match based on:\n- Name similarity to the query (exact matches prioritized)\n- Description relevance to the query's intent\n- Documentation coverage (prioritize libraries with higher Code Snippet counts)\n- Source reputation (consider libraries with High or Medium reputation more authoritative)\n- Benchmark Score: Quality indicator (100 is the highest score)\n\nResponse Format:\n- Return the selected library ID in a clearly marked section\n- Provide a brief explanation for why this library was chosen\n- If multiple good matches exist, acknowledge this but proceed with the most relevant one\n- If no good matches exist, clearly state this and suggest query refinements\n\nFor ambiguous queries, request clarification before proceeding with a best-guess match.\n\nIMPORTANT: Do not call this tool more than 3 times per question. If you cannot find what you need after 3 calls, use the best result you have.",
