perf: optimize adguard domain extraction loop

💡 **What:**
Replaced standard `for` loop + `append()` list operations with Python list comprehensions in both `extract_domains_from_file` and `extract_allowlist_domains_from_file`. Additionally optimized dictionary key lookups to avoid expensive nested `.get().get()` creating empty dicts when keys are missing.
Also wrapped the script execution under `if __name__ == '__main__':` so the functions can be safely imported and tested.

🎯 **Why:**
Python list comprehensions are evaluated in C, making them faster than sequential `.append()` calls inside a Python `for` loop.

📊 **Measured Improvement:**
Added a benchmark suite (`tests/benchmarks/benchmark_extract_domains.py`) to measure the performance improvement.
When isolating just the loop logic on 1,000,000 rules:
- `extract_domains` loop is ~1.12x faster (8.26s vs 9.25s over 100 runs)
- `extract_allowlist_domains` loop is ~1.32x faster (13.41s vs 17.71s over 100 runs)
When running end-to-end (which is heavily dominated by the underlying JSON I/O parsing), there is still an overall ~1.04x speedup.
