## Escalations (Require Human Action)

- `abhimehro/ctrld-sync#394` — merge conflict (`CONFLICTING/DIRTY`) with overlap against `#407`.
- `abhimehro/email-security-pipeline#381` — merge conflict on security-sensitive media analyzer changes.
- `abhimehro/email-security-pipeline#372` — conflicting semantic duplicate of `#381`; keep one path only.
- Duplicate/superseded closure backlog requires a token/app with PR close/comment scope.

## Consolidations

- Proposed for consolidation (not executed due permission limits):
  - `abhimehro/ctrld-sync#405, #402, #395` (test workflow overlap).
  - `abhimehro/ctrld-sync#406, #399` (parallel pytest overlap; keep one).
  - `abhimehro/email-security-pipeline#381, #372` (nested archive fix overlap).

## Patterns Observed

- Bot backlog has a high rate of superseded/zero-diff PRs (10 identified in this session).
- CI/workflow PRs are frequently duplicated with near-identical intent across adjacent PR numbers.
- Non-primary repos (`email-security-pipeline`, `ctrld-sync`) appear readable but not fully writable with current integration token.

## Metrics

- PRs reviewed: 41
- Merged: 5
- Fixed & merged: 0
- Closed (dup/stale): 0 (permission-limited)
- Escalated / blocked for human action: 36
- Estimated human review time saved: ~150 minutes (inventory + triage + five safe merges completed)
