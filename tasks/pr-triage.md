# PR Triage — 2026-07-15

**Session:** Automated PR review & cleanup (cron 13:00 UTC)  
**Mode:** review-and-merge  
**Preflight:** PASS 6/6 (+ repoprompt-ce)

## Decision matrix

| Decision | Count | Notes |
|----------|------:|-------|
| MERGE | 23 | Security-first ordering; all had green required CI |
| CLOSE | 6 | 3 Jules QA no-ops; 2 superseded session docs; 1 conflict close |
| ESCALATE | 5 | Unchanged security/supply-chain tail |
| DEFER | 4 | 2 merge conflicts; 1 Devin feature; 1 CI pending |

## Security gates

| PR | Gate | Rationale |
|----|------|-----------|
| hg #358, sc #224, pc #1616 | **MERGE** | Sentinel hardening; scoped fixes; all scans green |
| cs #990 | **ESCALATE** | SSRF allowlist + benchmark/ruff still red |
| esp #1259, hg #357 | **ESCALATE** | Supply-chain manifest changes need human review |
| sc #210, rpce #112 | **ESCALATE** | Auth/CLI trust boundaries; prior CHANGES_REQUESTED |

## Merge-conflict pattern (Lesson)

Sibling Bolt/Palette PRs touching the same files (#1620 before #1619, #363 before #364, #1011 before #1013) caused DIRTY state when merged in dependency order. **Rule:** merge smaller/single-file Palette PRs before broader Bolt PRs in the same repo, or route conflicts to Phase 2 salvage.

## Duplicate / no-op detection

| Group | Kept | Closed |
|-------|------|--------|
| Jules Daily QA (0 files) | — | pc #1614, Seatek #456, sc #226 |
| Session reports | today's branch commit | pc #1608, #1611 |
| Palette ANSI in ctrld-sync | #1011 merged | #1013 closed (conflict) |

# PR Triage — 2026-07-08

**Session:** Automated PR review & cleanup (cron 13:00 UTC)  
**Mode:** review-and-merge  
**Preflight:** PASS 6/6

## Decision matrix

| Decision | Count | PRs |
|----------|------:|-----|
| MERGE | 7 | pc #1542, #1539, #1545; Seatek #430; hg #330; sc #201 |
| CLOSE | 2 | pc #1540 (superseded draft); esp #1241 (no-op QA) |
| ESCALATE | 3 | pc #1544; cs #990; esp #1240 |
| DEFER | 5 | sc #204; rpce #100–#102, #105 |

## Security gates

| PR | Gate | Rationale |
|----|------|-----------|
| pc #1544 | **ESCALATE** | PR automation trust boundary — GH_TOKEN sourcing / injection hardening |
| esp #1240 | **ESCALATE** | Command injection fix in PR automation scripts |
| cs #990 | **ESCALATE** | SSRF domain allowlist + benchmark CI red |
| hg #330 | **MERGE** | Sentinel path-traversal hardening; `is_safe_path` + trusted `Path.cwd()` base; all CI green |
| All other merged PRs | PASS | No auth/payment/schema weakening; security scans green |

## Notable resolutions

### sc #201 unblocked

Deferred on 2026-07-07 for CodeScene red; re-triaged green on 2026-07-08 and merged.

### Jules no-op closure

esp #1241 had zero file changes (“No findings”) — closed rather than merged.

### Superseded session doc

pc #1540 draft salvage report superseded by `tasks/pr-review-2026-07-07.md` on `main`.

**Session:** Automated PR review & cleanup (cron 13:00 UTC)  
**Mode:** review-and-merge  
**Preflight:** PASS 6/6

## Decision matrix

| Decision | Count | PRs |
|----------|------:|-----|
| MERGE | 12 | pc #1531, #1530, #1537, #1527; cs #992; esp #1235, #1233; Seatek #425, #427; hg #326, #327; sc #202 |
| AUTO-FIX → MERGE | 1 | pc #1527 (palette.md conflict after #1530) |
| CLOSE | 1 | pc #1528 (superseded draft salvage report) |
| DEFER | 7 | cs #990; Seatek #426; sc #201; rpce #100–#103 |

## Security gates

| PR | Gate | Rationale |
|----|------|-----------|
| cs #990 | **ESCALATE** | SSRF domain allowlist — trust-boundary change; benchmark CI red unrelated to deps |
| sc #201 | DEFER + cs-agent | CodeScene health degradation on black format sweep |
| All merged PRs | PASS | No auth/payment/schema changes; security scans green |

## Duplicate & overlap analysis

### Palette journal conflict (resolved)

| Merged first | Blocked | Resolution |
|--------------|---------|------------|
| pc #1530 (ARIA landmarks + palette.md) | pc #1527 (performance report a11y) | Merged `origin/main` into #1527; kept both palette.md learning entries |

### Superseded draft

| Closed | Reason |
|--------|--------|
| pc #1528 | Evening salvage report draft from 2026-07-06 superseded by this session |

### Dependabot codescene-agent cluster

Same SHA bump (`841e34c7` → `bbc72fbfb8`) across 6 repos — all merged where CI green. repoprompt-ce copies deferred on Style/Build failures (macOS gate).

## Deferred follow-ups

    reason: ESCALATE — SSRF allowlist + benchmark fail; human security review
