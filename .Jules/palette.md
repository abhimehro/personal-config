## 2024-05-23 - CLI UX Enhancement
**Learning:** Even without a graphical UI, "micro-UX" matters significantly in CLI tools. Adding visual hierarchy (indentation, spacing), semantic colors (Green/Active, Red/Stopped), and relatable symbols (🤖, 📡) reduces cognitive load when checking system status.
**Action:** When designing CLI output, treat it like a UI: group related information, use whitespace for breathing room, and map technical values (IPs, UIDs) to human-readable concepts (Localhost, Profile Names).
