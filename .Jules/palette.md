## 2024-05-23 - CLI Feedback Consistency
**Learning:** Users judge the quality of a CLI tool by its visual polish and consistency. The current installer uses plain text while the bootstrap script uses emojis. This inconsistency breaks the "professional" feel.
**Action:** Unify CLI logging helpers across scripts to use consistent emoji prefixes (ℹ️, ✅, ⚠️, ❌) and structured "Plan of Action" summaries. This establishes a stronger brand identity for the toolset.
