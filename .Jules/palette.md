## 2025-11-20 - CLI Output Enhancement
**Learning:** Adding emojis and structured formatting (tables, indentation) to shell script output significantly improves readability and user delight, even in a text-based interface. Mocks are essential for verifying visual changes in scripts that rely on system commands (like `networksetup`) unavailable in the dev environment.
**Action:** When working on CLI tools, always check if the output can be "humanized" with emojis and better spacing. Use temporary mocks to verify visual formatting when system commands are missing.
